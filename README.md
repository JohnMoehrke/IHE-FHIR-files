# IHE-FHIR-Support

These are various files that are being publicly shared as part of the IHE work efforts that profile FHIR.  Initially this will cover profiles prepared by the IHE IT Infrastructure committee. See http://www.ihe.net/ for information about IHE in general, http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/ITI_Technical_Committee for information about and activities of the IHE IT Infrastructure Committee, and http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Profiles for information about IHE profiles.

The license is initially set as CC-BY 4.0 license.  This may change.  The final results will be published under the usual IHE licensing terms.  These are mostly working documents, backup material, references, etc.

These also include FHIR support documents, such as structure definitions.  These are freely available for use when implementing software that conforms to the IHE profiles.
